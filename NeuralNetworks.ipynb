      "\n",
      "Neural Networks are a class of algorithm that attempt to remedy the principal gaps between computational and biological systems. There is no such thing as \"a neural network\", rather the term describes a class of models with different implementations, one of the most simple of which- the perceptron- we'll be covering later in this talk. The major benefits the use of neural networks afford computer programmers and mathematicians are their self-organization and learning capability, capability to generalize from relatively small data sets, and fault tolerance.

      "I think a regular question people have with these sorts of algorithms is what sort of problem space to which they are suited. Let's assume you have a simple robot with three sensors on the front right, three on the front left and two on the back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, let's assume we're also dealing with some real value as an input $\\mathbb{I} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ to the sensor and make even simpler by assuming that this signal is binary with H = 0 meaning everything is ok and H = 1 alerting the robot to stop. Now what we want to do is take these signals and make the robot move effectively; a problem that can be described mathematically as $\\mathbb{f}$ : $\\mathbb{R}^8 \\in \\mathbb{B}^1$, or to put it in human we want some function that applies the signals to a robot activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we can either go and get coffee and take a walk and try to think very hard of what the most effective way of solving the problem is and of course in a simple problem like this it would not be very difficult to solve. This is the classical AI approach emblematized with artificial intelligence sysems like Deep Blue. Rules of behaving were encoded and then more rules were generated for effectively searching through and selecting through these rules. While these approaches are beneficial when applied to closed systems like chess, it is difficult to use them in order to solve real world problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "A more interesting way of solving this problem is creating some method for the robot to learn. Once again this example is extremely trivial, but a lot of things that we'd be interesting in having aritfiically intelligent systems do are messy and ambiguous and dynamic. You can't always come up with the rules in advance, and having a system that can come up with it's own most effective way of doing something is an enormous asset. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let's summarize exactly what we're going to do in this sort of scenario. We're going to take the robot and show it a variety of different situations and hopes that it learns to stop effectively. In this example what we're going to call a \"training sample\"  is a set of sensor values which we show to the robot and a set of actions we force it to perform. Thus more generally a training set can be understood to consist of a set of idealized inputs and a corresponding desired output. We call the inputs idealized because again ideally the training set would consist of data that emblematizes the whole range of data the system will encounter after training. \n",

      "\n",
      "While a lot of people perceive neural networks as a relatively modern development, the construction of the first neural networks actually conincides with the invention of the first programmable computers in the 1940s. Two researchers, Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts created models of neurological networks and demonstrated that even these simple models were able to compute elementary logic problems. While neural networks started as a sort of proof of concept of the then somewhat contentious neuron theory of the brain (i.e. that atomic units rather than a uniform and undifferentiated mass could be capable of producing what we perceive as a relatively organic or holistic or what have you perception of consciousness), any self-respecting neuroscientist today would bristle at the suggestion that neural networks, a rather cartoonish depiction of the complexity of the human brain, would have the ability to generate insight into biological processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "After McCulloch and Pitts there was the neuroscientist Donald Hebb. If any of you have taken elementary courses in biology and neuroscience you've probably heard the refrain that \"neurons that fire together wire together\". Or the less cute version:\n",
      "\n",
      ">\"The general idea is an old one, that any two cells or systems of cells that are repeatedly active at the same time will tend >to become 'associated', so that activity in one facilitates activity in the other.\"- Donald Hebb\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an extremely important idea. In the same way Bernoulli and Maxwell introduced statistics to mechanics, and Darwin allowed for history in biology, Hebb's theory introduces the importance of probability in neurological reactions. As we'll see later this forms the theoretical backbone of neural networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hebb's theory of learning was found to have a biological basis by Eric Kandel's work in long-term potentiation. Kandel was able to demonstrate a physiological analogue to classical conditioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Minsky went on to develop the first neural network that took advantage of Hebb's expansive theories on the neuron. The program, named SNARC didn't necessarily do anything but was capable of altering the weight of its connections.\n"
